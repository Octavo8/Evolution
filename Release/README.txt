HOW TO USE
------------

1. Always click Create a New Population first.
	This generates a population of 500 creatures, each with a randomly generated brain.
2. Evolve by 1 Generation
	This will run a simulation for each of the 500 creatures, calculating what its brain
	would do, and giving it a score, based on how many food pellets it managed to find
	in 100 moves.
3. Evolve by 25 Generations
	Easier than clicking the Evolve by 1 multiple times. Might take a while. Isn't actually 25 generations.
4. Little up/down box thingy
	Tells you which generation you are viewing stats for. Also serves to select which generation of creatures 
	to simulate
5. Simulate Individuals
	Each time a population is evolved, a copy of one of the best creatures, as well as one from the median creatures
	is stored. This allows you to view how the winner and media brain from any given generation actually behaved.
	
	
SIMULATION
-----------
On the left will be the median brain for the generation, on the right, the winner.
The grids are centered on the food pellet and the creature is drawn and a blue elipse based on their position.
By clicking "Simulate Creature Move", a single step is executed and the creature will move according to what his brain 
tells him to do.


TIPS
-----
If after 75 generations, your creatures suck, try creating a new population.
